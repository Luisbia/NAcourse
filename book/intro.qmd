# Introduction

This short guide is intended as a basic reference to understand the basics of National Accounts Main Aggregates (NAMA) and Supply and Use Tables (SUT) and the close interrelationships between the two from a practical point of view. We will omit some technical details and will provide just a practical overview. Both set of accounts describe the production, expenditure and income flows of an economy in a consistent way but using a different approach. We will not deal here with other parts of the National Accounts (sector accounts, financial accounts) although some reference to concepts like sectors and institutional units will need to be made. On the other hand, we will talk about classifications, codes and other practical aspects of the ESA 2010 transmission programme that are necessary for understanding the context and the practical use of the tables.

It is mainly intended with people with some familiarity with National Accounts that want to have a general understanding of the main variables and concepts used in both areas and how they relate to each other.
